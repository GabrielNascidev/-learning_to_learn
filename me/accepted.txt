I, by choosing to participate in the pool and/or study at 42 São Paulo, declare that I will respect the rules mentioned in the PDFs attached to the project, as well as the moral values ​​they convey. I understand that failure to follow these rules will normally lead to my exclusion from 42, especially in cases of cheating or disrespect towards other students, staff or external visitors.
